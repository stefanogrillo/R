This repository aims to summarize my experience in Data Analysis with R Language, _**solutions are uploaded from time to time**_

My journey started from the book [Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed; Authors: Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos)](https://otexts.com/fpp2/index.html)_,
which I have already studied in my master degree. I will upload my code to create a stable repository.
