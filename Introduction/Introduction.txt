Forecasting is a common statistical task in business, but it can be confused with planning and goals.
So, forecasting is about predicting the future with a high degree of accuracy. To do so, we can use every information available, such as historical data and any
future events that might have an impact on the forecasts. Goals are objective that we would like to achieve, and that need to be supported by a plan.
As such, planning is the selection and use of an appropriate set of actions to achieve goals. Planning can be strenghtened by forecasting, because the lattest 
can highlight the most important factors involved.

Forecasting can be of two typologies: qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative f. does not involve data, while quantitative forecasting does. In particular,
the quantitative f. can be applied with two conditions: numerical information about the past is available, and it is reasonable to assume the past trend will
continue.

In forecasting, there are 5 main steps: (1) defining the problem, (2) gathering information, (3) doing a preliminary (exploratory) analysis, (4) choosing and 
fitting models, and (5) using and evaluating the forecasting model.
The step nÂ° (1) involves creating relationships with people involved in the data collection, in the database maintenance, and also with the final users of the 
forecasts. The (2)nd step involves gathering statistical data, in an appropriate quantity and for a long timespan. The (3)rd step is to graph the data to look
for patterns (trends, seasonality, business cycles, outliers). The (4)rth step is to compare those models that might fit the data. Finally, the (5)fth step is 
to valuate the fit of the forecast model to the data.
